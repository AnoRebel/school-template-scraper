# Requisites

We need the following to run this script successfully:  
1. I'm using python 3.5.2, so i don't know about other versions, but i think it would work on any python 3.x version(www.python.org)  
2. MongoDB, a NoSql database system that has no schema, very fast and good(www.mongodb.org)  
3. Python module for mongo, PyMongo, get it by using pip(pip install pymongo), and read about it on (http://api.mongodb.com/python/current/tutorial.html)  
4. Either the 'requests' module(pip insall requests) or the 'urllib2' module(pip install yield.urllib2)(I think this is the command..)  
5. The time function which comes with python by default, we use this to time our program so it doesn't overload the server with our requests  
6. BeautifulSoup4, i use this for the scraping bussiness but you can use any scraper you're used to, (pip install bs4) or (pip install beautifulsoup4)  
You need a good internet connection to make it run fast.. 
Make sure your Database is running while runnin this program or else it wont save, or it will show an error..  
Also, the general.py is a combination of both the primary.py and secondary.py, you can run the two or you can just run general.py..  Incase of any problem, contact me.
